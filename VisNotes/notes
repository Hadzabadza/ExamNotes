-Difference between polar/cartesian coordinates?
Polar is based on 2 properties - direction and distance, cartesian is based on axes.
-How to convert between the two?
Using trigonometric functions.
Cartesian - polar: atan of angle (depending on the quadrants).
Polar - cartesian: take cosine + sin of an angle and multiply the hypotenuse by them.

-What’s the most interesting and challenging aspect of the Mandelbrot set algorithm?
I find the use of complex numbers in the algorithm the most interesting part as it makes me think in a new way.

-How do we get the distance between 2 X-D points?
Pythagoras:
sqrt((n1*n1)+(n2*n2)+…+(nk*nk))

-What’s a platonic solid?
Platonic solids are tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron. The properties of edges in these shapes are: all vertices have the same amount of edges meeting at them and all the edges have the same angle and between the adjacent ones while all having the same length.

-What’s a good way of thinking about the structure of a sphere?
It’s a platonic solid with infinite vertices.

-What’s a normal?
A normal is a direction assigned to a vertex/surface which defines it’s colour depending on the angle of lighting sources. Basically a reflection angle.

-What’s the difference between UV and ST?
UV mapping uses coordinates of vertices which form a face to apply a texture to. ST are transformed UV coordinates, which define an area of a texture to “cut from”.

-What’s the difference between difference and distance?
Difference is the angle between two vectors while distance is a vector which is a subtraction of two.??????????

-With respect to distances between vectors, what is the magnitude?
Magnitude is the distance between the origin and a vector. 

—How do we calculate a unit vector?
We can get a unit vector by dividing the vector by it’s magnitude. 
v(x,y)=(x/sqrt((x^2)+(y^2)),y/sqrt((x^2)+(y^2)))

-Can you explain what a bump map is?
It’s a collection of normals applied in such a way as to make an impression of small irregularities or bumps (hence the name) on a shape without having to use comparatively more expensive vertices.
