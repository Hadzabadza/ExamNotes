-Difference between polar/cartesian coordinates?
Polar is based on 2 properties - direction and distance, cartesian is based on axes.
-How to convert between the two?
Using trigonometric functions.
Cartesian - polar: atan of angle (depending on the quadrants).
Polar - cartesian: take cosine + sin of an angle and multiply the hypotenuse by them.

-What is the most interesting and challenging aspect of the Mandelbrot set algorithm?
I find the use of complex numbers in the algorithm the most interesting part as it makes me think in a new way.

-How do we get the distance between 2 X-D points?
Pythagoras:
sqrt((n1*n1)+(n2*n2)+â€¦+(nk*nk))

-What is a platonic solid?
A platonic solid is a shape in which every edge has an exact same angle between all adjacent edges.
